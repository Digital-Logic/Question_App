# Question_App

Simple question, answer billboard built with Nuxt.js. Currently this project is missing quit a few features, Notable, submission forms. The reason for this is that Nuxt server middleware seams limited a creating rest api, and I choose not to add a detected express server at this time.

Uses custom build Grid system, and UI components. /ui route will display a basic response grid layout.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
